# Machine Learning for predicting USed car sales prices
## A random forest model was shown to accurately predict prices

** Coire Gavin-Hanner **

### Business Problem
Car sales people can use this model to predict for how much vehicles will sell. 

### Data

The data set came from the Kaggle

## Insights

cars from Germany depreciate faster than cars from Japan or France

## Model Summary

I used a Random Forest Regression model to predict item sales. It had an r-squared value of 0.897
and an RMSE value of 7349.
## Final Recommendations

There is still more exploration to be done on how feature engineering can improve the model. In addition, more combinations for parameters for the random forest can be explored
